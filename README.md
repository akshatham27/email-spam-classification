# sms/email spam classification 
SMS/Email spam classification is a process of identifying and categorizing unsolicited messages, such as spam SMS or spam emails, as either legitimate (ham) or illegitimate (spam). Spam messages are typically sent in bulk and may contain malicious content, phishing attempts, or unwanted advertisements. The classification process involves analyzing the content of the message, including the text, sender information, and other metadata, to determine its legitimacy.
Types of Spam Messages
There are several types of spam messages, including:
1)Phishing spam: These messages attempt to trick the recipient into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
2)Malware spam: These messages contain malicious software or links to download malware.
3)Advertising spam: These messages promote products or services, often in a deceptive or misleading manner.
4)Social engineering spam: These messages aim to manipulate the recipient into performing a specific action, such as clicking on a link or downloading an attachment.

Classification Techniques
Several techniques are used to classify SMS/Email spam, including:
Machine learning algorithms: These algorithms analyze the content of the message and learn to identify patterns and characteristics of spam messages.
Rule-based systems: These systems use predefined rules to identify spam messages, such as keywords or sender information.
Collaborative filtering: This technique involves analyzing the behavior of other users to identify spam messages.

Challenges in Spam Classification
     spam classification faces several challenges, including:
Evolving nature of spam: Spammers continually adapt and evolve their tactics to evade detection.
Limited training data: The availability of labeled training data can be limited, making it difficult to train accurate classification models.
False positives: Legitimate messages may be misclassified as spam, resulting in false positives.
